# The Assignment
Your task is to create a set of RESTful APIs for managing a task tracking system. Within this system, users can create tasks, mark them as completed, and retrieve task summaries. Use Go as your primary programming language, and opt for either MySQL or PostgreSQL as the database system.

## To Do

1. **Database Schema Design**. Provide your proposed Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) schema. Consider indexes, relationships, naming conventions, and adhere to best practices in database design.
2. **Create a New Task**. Write an endpoint to create a new task that includes title, description, and due date.
3. **Update Existing Tasks**. Write an endpoint to update existing tasks and set the task status to 'completed'.
4. **List Existing Tasks**. Write an endpoint to list existing tasks. Implement filters and pagination for enhanced usability.
5. **Technical Documentation**. Create clear and concise technical documentation. Ensure it is simple and easy to understand for developers who may use or maintain the APIs.

## Constraints

1. **Code Readability**: Write code that is easily understandable by other developers.
2. **Customer Experience**: Consider the end-user experience when designing and implementing your APIs.
3. **Security**: Implement security measures to protect against potential threats.
4. **Authentication**: Ensure that your APIs are secured by implementing some form of authentication.
5. **No ORM Usage**: Do not use any Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools; write the queries manually.
6. **Include Tests**: Provide comprehensive tests to validate the functionality and robustness of your APIs.

## What We Will Assess
1. The design choices made in constructing your APIs for efficiency and coherence.
2. Overall quality of your code, focusing on readability, maintainability, and adherence to best coding practices.
3. Effectiveness of your chosen RDBMS schema, considering factors such as indexing, relationships, and adherence to established database design best practices.
4. Evaluate your use of Git for version control. Ensure that your commits are clear, logically organized, and follow best practices. Consider branching strategies and commit messages for better understanding.
5. Completeness and effectiveness of your tests. Assess whether they adequately cover various scenarios and contribute to the overall reliability of your solution.
6. Clarity and conciseness of your technical documentation. Ensure that it provides sufficient information for others to understand and work with your APIs.

## Submission

1. **Version Control**: Push your commits to your private repository.
2. **Notification**: Inform our recruiter once you have completed and pushed your solution.
